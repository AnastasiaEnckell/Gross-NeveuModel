# Gross-Neveu Model simulation
These are the scripts I wrote for my master's thesis (link). The programs simulate the massive Gross-Neveu model with the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. The simulations are created with the QuantumSimulator package https://github.com/MarcelNiedermeier/QuantumSimulator. The instructions for the installation are found at the same link.
